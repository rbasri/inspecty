      <p class="lead">Buying a home can be scary. For many Americans, a home represents the most significant investment they will make in their lifetimes. Unfortunately, many problems can lie beneath the surface of your dream abode, hidden from the untrained eye. Radon, termites, and mold, oh my! </p>

      <p>This is why nearly three quarters of Americans choose to purchase a home inspection prior to closing. During the inspection, a trained professional examines every nook and cranny in your home for issues that could require fixes. Should any issues be found, it would most likely have a material impact on the fair value of the home, and could ultimately save a buyer from overpaying. </p>

      <p>So, home inspections are a great thing! Unfortunately, they're not so easy to set up. What credentials should you look for? Who in your area has those credentials? How much should you pay for an inspection? Finding the answers to these questions could take some time. One option is to google a list of inspectors in your area and call them to hear their pitch and receive a quote. Another option is to accept a recommendation from your realtor, but these are occassionally based on relationships rather than quality of service or price. Fortunately, Inspecty Homes offers a better way.</p>
